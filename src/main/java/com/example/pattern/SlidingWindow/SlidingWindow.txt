Sliding Window pattern helps to solve problems
where we have to find a contiguous subarray of size k that has the largest sum or the smallest sum or the target sum.
The pattern helps to optimize the brute-force solution and reduce the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

The Sliding Window pattern works by creating a window of size k and sliding it to the right.
The window slides one element at a time, and we calculate the sum of the elements inside the window.

The window starts from the 0th index and slides to the right until the end of the array.
The window size is fixed, and we calculate the sum of the elements inside the window.
We can use the window to find the maximum sum, minimum sum, or target sum of the subarray.

The Sliding Window pattern is useful when we have to find the maximum sum, minimum sum, or target sum of a subarray of size k.
